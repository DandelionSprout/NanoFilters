# Nano Filters

Script snippets and filters for Nano Adblocker

These resources are designed for Nano Adblocker and may not always work as expected with uBlock Origin out of the box. 
See [filter incompatibility](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/blob/master/Notes/FilterIncompatibility.MD) for more details. 

Third party filters were cached on 2018-01-07. Cache will be updated on every 
release of Nano Adblocker. 

Please open an issue if there is something you want us to know. 

## Filter Policy

If an issue is taken care by a default (regional) filter, then it will not be fixed again in NanoFilters. 

Ads will be removed unless it is non-intrusive self-promotion. 

Any form of anti-adblock will be removed unless it tests for an auto-starting mining wall. 

Timers and other form of annoyance will be removed if we consider appropriate and if possible. 

Tracking are to be handled in EasyPrivacy or uAssets. 

Third party whitelists must be added to `Nano filters â€“ Whitelist`. 

`Nano filters` and `Nano filters - Whitelist` should keep compatibility with uBlock Origin when possible. 

Deprecated features should never be used.
